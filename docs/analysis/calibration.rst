Calibrating the Data
===========================

Before any other post-processing steps are performed, all data should be calibrated. 

.. note:: Any data listed in :ref:`_samurai_data` will already be calibrated, but for any new data the following steps must be taken.

Calibration is typically performed using a script that calls the :class:`samurai.analysis.calibration.CalibrateSamurai`.
