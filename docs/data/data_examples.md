# Data Usage Examples
Here we give some examples on how to use the provided SAMURAI data. Examples are given in both Python and MATLAB

## Loading the Data

The data can be loaded using the `metafile.json` file contained with each measurement

	### Python 
	```python
	# Python loading code here
	```

	### MATLAB 
	```matlab
	% MATLAB loading code here
	```


## Operating on the Data

Here we can have an example on how to deal with the S parameter data (block data and object extraction)

	### Python 
	```python
	# Python loading code here
	```

	### MATLAB 
	```matlab
	% MATLAB loading code here
	```

## Conventional Beamforming Example

Now we can perform conventional beamforming on the data. also test math environment $$ sum_{n=1}^N S(n)a=\frac{1}{2}c_0 $$

	### Python 
	```python
