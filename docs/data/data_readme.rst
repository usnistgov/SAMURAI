Optical Table Measurements 2018
-----------------------------------

- :data_root:`2018/`

4-13-2018
++++++++++++++++
This day we measured a flat plane that spans the whole reach of the positioner. The steps of this are much larger than a single wavelength
and the total aperture size is >10 wavelengths. This data will probably not be used

- :data_root:`2018/04-13-2018/`


5-11-2018
++++++++++++++++
This was the initial day where line of sight synthetic apertures were tested. The vna was set to a frequency range of 28-30 GHz with 20MHz steps
Both a measurement with the transmitter about 10 degrees in the azimuth direction and 5 degrees in the elevation offset from the reciever were taken
Again both are contained within the '/calibrated' folder

- :data_root:`2018/05-11-2018/`

5-15-2018
++++++++++++++++
Another line of sight was taken here the the transmitter both 10 degrees in the azimuth and 5 degrees in elevation at the same time
Measurements on this day were taken from 26.5 to 40GHz with a step of 10MHz and an IFBW of 10. 

- :data_root:`2018/05-15-2018/`

5-24-2018
++++++++++++++++
This setup was measuring a reflection off the front face (with windows) of the cabinets in a non-LOS setup

- :data_root:`2018/05-24-2018/`

5-31-2018
++++++++++++++++
This is the same setup as 5-24 but with a much large array size to allow for finer angular resolution.

- :data_root:`2018/05-31-2018/`

12-12-2018
++++++++++++++++
This was the initial day of measurements using the new SAMURAI setup with the Meca500 positioner and the optical table. In this configuration the cabinets with attached absorber were directly behind the meca500 with absorber covering the vna on the left (from behind the meca view) and absorber covering the table. There was also absorber behind the transmit antenna.

- :data_root:`2018/12-12-2018/`

The setup for this day was the same as 12-12-2018 but removed the absorber from the middle part of the table. 

- :data_root:`2018/12-17-2018/`

12-18-2018 
++++++++++++++++
The setup for this day was the same as 12-12-2018 but removed the cabinetes from behind the recieve side.

- :data_root:`2018/12-18-2018/`

12-19-2018
++++++++++++++++
The setup was again the same as 12-12-2018 but a small piece of absorber with spikes on it was placed in the center on top of the flat absorber to try and reduce the ground bounce from the absorber.

8-7-2019
+++++++++++++
First day of real measurements in CUP. THis was taken without the rack in a high multipath environement. Both Tx and Rx in this case were pointed toward the control panel. 
The transmitter for this day was slightly angled upward toward the control panel whereas the aperture was about level with the control panel.

- :data_root:`Central_Utility_Plant/8-7-2019/`

Dataset Information
===========================

The folders are named in the following manner

	(month)-(date)-(year)

Within each folder there is a subfolder named '/calibrated' This folder contains the most up to date calibrated data for the run and that data 
should be used for calculations.

Each subfolder within this folder contains data from a measurement. Within each of these subfolders there exists a set of measurements named 'meas#.s2p'
and a metafile named 'metaFile.json'. This metafile contains almost all information regarding to the measurement setup and run.

metaFile Description
---------------------------

The metafile is a \*.json file (typically under the name metaFile.json) that provides useful information to both load and track information on the measurements
This file is easily human readable and information on the experiment can be found at the top of the file. The following set of keys are 
the most useful within the file

 - 'working_directory' : provides the path to the current directory
 - 'experiment' : very brief info on the experiment
 - 'vna_info' : a dictionary with information on the VNA settings used during the experiment
 - 'antennas' : a list of dictionaries describing characteristics of the antennas used
 - 'notes' : More information about the experiment
 - 'measurements' : a list of dictionaries containing the following info
 
    - 'position_key' : what each position is
    - 'position'     : position used for each value in position_key
    - 'filename'     : location of the file (relative to working_directory) of the file

There are a few other keys within the file but these are the most useful. A 'units' key has been added in later versions to give the units of the axes
