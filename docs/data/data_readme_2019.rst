Information for Measurements Conducted on :code:`8-7-2019`
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
First day of real measurements in CUP. THis was taken without the rack in a high multipath environement. Both Tx and Rx in this case were pointed toward the control panel. 
The transmitter for this day was slightly angled upward toward the control panel whereas the aperture was about level with the control panel.
