Optical Table Measurements 2018
-----------------------------------

- :data_root:`2018/`

4-13-2018
++++++++++++++++
This day we measured a flat plane that spans the whole reach of the positioner. The steps of this are much larger than a single wavelength
and the total aperture size is >10 wavelengths. This data will probably not be used

5-11-2018
++++++++++++++++
This was the initial day where line of sight synthetic apertures were tested. The vna was set to a frequency range of 28-30 GHz with 20MHz steps
Both a measurement with the transmitter about 10 degrees in the azimuth direction and 5 degrees in the elevation offset from the reciever were taken
Again both are contained within the '/calibrated' folder

- :data_root:`2018/05-11-2018/`

5-15-2018
++++++++++++++++
Another line of sight was taken here the the transmitter both 10 degrees in the azimuth and 5 degrees in elevation at the same time
Measurements on this day were taken from 26.5 to 40GHz with a step of 10MHz and an IFBW of 10.

5-24-2018
++++++++++++++++
This setup was measuring a reflection off the front face (with windows) of the cabinets in a non-LOS setup

- :data_root:`2018/05-24-2018/`

5-31-2018
++++++++++++++++
This is the same setup as 5-24 but with a much large array size to allow for finer angular resolution.

- :data_root:`2018/05-31-2018/`

12-12-2018
++++++++++++++++
This was the initial day of measurements using the new SAMURAI setup with the Meca500 positioner and the optical table. In this configuration the cabinets with attached absorber were directly behind the meca500 with absorber covering the vna on the left (from behind the meca view) and absorber covering the table. There was also absorber behind the transmit antenna.

12-17-2018
++++++++++++++++
The setup for this day was the same as 12-12-2018 but removed the absorber from the middle part of the table. 

- :data_root:`2018/12-17-2018/`

12-18-2018 
++++++++++++++++
The setup for this day was the same as 12-12-2018 but removed the cabinetes from behind the recieve side.

- :data_root:`2018/12-18-2018/`

12-19-2018
++++++++++++++++
The setup was again the same as 12-12-2018 but a small piece of absorber with spikes on it was placed in the center on top of the flat absorber to try and reduce the ground bounce from the absorber.
