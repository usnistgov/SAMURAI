Taking the first measurement
------------------------------

Assuming the setup and hardware is the same or close to that in the SAMURAI lab (more info should be added on this), 
the first measurement can be taken using the steps on how to run from a script described in :ref:`running-samurai`

.. todo:: More information on the hardware setup may be useful. Unless it is found to be described enough in :ref:`hardware-config`
