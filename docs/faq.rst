**Q:** How do I incorporate more devices into my sweeps?


**A:** Custom scripts will be required for this depending on the application. Running :code:`SAMURAI_System.csv_sweep()` multiple times with 
external information in multiple different metafiles can be a solution to this. 
Otherwise, developing a custom script based off of the code in :code:`SAMURAI_System.csv_sweep()` may provide the best results
without changing the metafile or file structure.
