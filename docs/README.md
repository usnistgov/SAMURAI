# Documentation folder for SAMURAI

All of this final docs are built using sphinx.

# Building the Docs

To build the documentation, open a command prompt (I have only tested this with anaconda prompt) and run `make html`.

This will build the docs into ./_build/html/

# Requirements

- MATLAB Sphinx support - run `pip install sphinxcontrib-matlabdomain` or go to https://pypi.org/project/sphinxcontrib-matlabdomain/
